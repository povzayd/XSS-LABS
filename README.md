### 🧠 What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** is a type of **security vulnerability** that allows an attacker to **inject malicious code (usually JavaScript)** into a website or web application. This code then **runs in the browser** of other users who visit the site.

---

### 🧨 Why is it dangerous?

Because it lets attackers:

* Steal cookies, session tokens, or personal data
* Trick users into clicking fake buttons or links (phishing)
* Deface the website or redirect users elsewhere
* Hijack user accounts or perform actions on their behalf

---

### 🔍 How does it happen?

It usually happens when a website:

1. **Takes user input** (like in a search box or comment field)
2. **Displays it back** on the page **without properly cleaning it**
3. So an attacker can input something like:

   ```html
   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
   
and get xss triggered!

### What is **XSS-LABS**?
Absolutely! Here's a more **detailed and structured description** of your XSS Lab project that includes lab breakdowns, learning goals, and technical depth — ideal for a **README**, a **project report**, or a **homepage description**:

## 🧪 XSS LAB – Complete XSS Vulnerability Training Ground

This project is a hands-on **web security lab** designed to help learners understand and exploit the three major types of **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities:
🔁 **Reflected**, 🗃️ **Stored**, and 🧠 **DOM-Based XSS**.

---

### 🚀 Project Structure [TRY NOW!](https://povzayd.github.io/XSS-LABS)

The lab is divided into diffrent escalating levels of difficulty:

---

### ◾ Lab 1 – Beginner Level: Basic Injection

**Focus:** Introduces how unfiltered user input is executed as code.

* Users can enter simple scripts like:

  ```html
  <script>alert(87)</script>
  ```
* Demonstrates:

  * Basic **reflected XSS** (via query parameters or form input)
  * **Stored XSS** (through input saved and re-displayed)
  * A basic example of **DOM-based XSS**
* Suitable for beginners to understand how careless input handling results in direct script execution.

---

### ◾ Lab 2 – Intermediate Level: Context Breakout

**Focus:** Teaches bypassing more complex filters and escaping HTML contexts.

* Requires crafted payloads such as:

  ```html
  "><script>alert(87)</script>
  ```
* Demonstrates:

  * How XSS works when injection occurs inside HTML attributes, tags, or JS contexts
  * DOM manipulation vulnerabilities where user input is processed via JavaScript (e.g., `location.hash`, `innerHTML`, `document.write`)
* Helps learners practice **breaking out of quotes, attributes, or tags** — simulating real-world attack scenarios.

---
### ◾ Lab 3 – Coming Soon
---
### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these labs, users will:

* Understand the **differences** between Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based XSS
* Learn to **identify vulnerable input/output handling**
* Gain hands-on experience with **payload crafting** and **context-based escaping**
* Improve awareness of **secure coding best practices**
---
### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This lab is intended **strictly for educational purposes**.
Do not attempt these techniques on any live websites or systems without **explicit permission**.

### 👾 Built by web security explorers, For web security explorers

This project was crafted with ⚔️ passion and 💻 precision by:

* **[Unass](https://github.com/una55)**                                                                                                                                              
* **[Zaid](https://github.com/povzayd)**                                                                                                                                                                                                             

We built this lab to help others **learn, break, and secure** — because the best way to defend the web is to understand how it’s broken.

> 🙏 Special thanks to the community of web security explorers and learners who inspire us to push boundaries, ask better questions, and share knowledge freely.
